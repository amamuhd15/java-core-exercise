Java Fundamentals Practice

This repository contains Java code I wrote during  my2nd year university courses in computer programming. I have completed two semesters of Java programming, and this repo includes key concepts like:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance & Polymorphism
- control structure
- Collections (List, Array)
- Basic Algorithms and Data Structures

I'm currently doing a SIWES internship in backend development and created this repo to show my background so I can potentially move to more advanced work.
